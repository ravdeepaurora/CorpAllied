Code is not fully optimised as I am new to ASP .Net
For a Demo check ravdeep.azurewebsites.net(might be slow due to free server and yes you can register on this site)
Its a website bootstrap enabled having few features of Facebook such as Status Like Comments Chats and LinkedIn Applying Jobs..
It is still under development hence its partial features are working right now.
Inbox is static messaging that is users need to refresh page to check new messages as I could not implement SignalR!
If anyone could contribute kindly implement signal r and optimize code
