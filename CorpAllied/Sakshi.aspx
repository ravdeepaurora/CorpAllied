Well like i told you, about your desire: Which was to write something about you on Facebook like people do usually for others, but I won't write on Facebook for 2 reasons:
                    1) That I wanted it to remain till us only.
                    2) You don't need people to show what you are!
Ok moving on well, from the past two years we have been great friends and cherish each and every moment i had spent with you. You are a great friend of mine being with me all the time,
despite of me doing alot of crazy and stupid stuff, being SENTI(but not right now),hurting you(don't want to remind how and when :P). Thanks for being there everytime.
                    Abh to Pta chal GYA HOGA ki Surprise kis cheez ka hai???
I told you i could write an essay on you but who reads an essay these days so I thought of taking advantage of my engineering :P :P..........
<br />
                    OUR FRIENDSHIP IS LIKE PLAYING A SEESAW. NOT ONLY BECAUSE ITS ALWAYS FUN WITH YOU BUT ALSO BECAUSE I WOULDN'T MIND GOING DOWN TO SEE YOU RISING!!<br />
                    IN THIS WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING SEEMS UNCERTAIN ONLY ONE THING IS DEFINITE. CAN YOU GUESS WHAT THAT COULD BE: NO? LEMME TELL YOU! YOUR ALWAYS GONNA BE MY FRIEND BEYOND WORDS, BEYONG TIME AND BEYOND DISTANCE!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This idea was long ago in my mind, but was waiting some moment to happen, like yesterday nights fight!!!! No matter with whom do I stay, with whom you are I wont stop caring about you my friend, your like a gods gift to me and I dont want to loose it at any cost!! <br />
                    And regarding the PRIZE TALK YESTERDAY, You need not to be a prize to be won by someone, Your friendship is the actual prize which is only achieved by a few!! Don't know kal kya baat hui regarding this but actually to agar prize bni toh kisi ko lene nhi dunga!!!
                    Abhi to terko car chalani bhi sikhani hai jabh aap free ho!!!! Aise Gussa nhi hote.....Bade Bade shehro me choti choti batte hoti rehti hai !!!!! Akhir me laut ke budhu ne tumare pass hi aana!!.....
                    Tum jaisa dost kho ke marna thodi naa hai!!........ You know i have much more to say but dont know how to express what you mean to... how special you are to me!!! Even yeah bhi socha tha yeh sara shirt pe likhu tumare but itni space nhi thi and also fir socha ek nayi shirt pe sirf yeh sabbh likhu
                    but tumare size ki shirt pe hardly ek para hi ayega and shirt ne full hojana tha!!<br />
                    And jitna i guess know you, You must have thought some materialistic gift i would be giving you..
                    well i already told you dont hv high expectations..... yeh i know kch nhi hai but agar mai yeh tumari wall pe post krunga toh logo ne galat leh lena and facebook ne hang ho jana!!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In the end jide marzi kol chali jaana..... Leh mai wapis ape leh aau!!! Bhawe bande kutiye bhawe GUGU nu
